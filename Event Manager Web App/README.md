# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Refresh done through Batch Processing: The plugin enables lightning-fast React component updates, allowing you to see changes in your code instantly without losing the current state of your application. This smooth and efficient development experience is a game-changer, boosting your productivity and iteration speed.

Automatic JSX Runtime: The plugin automatically configures the JSX runtime to use the newer "automatic" mode, simplifying the setup process and reducing the overall bundle size of your application.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
